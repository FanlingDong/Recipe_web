Week1
We started a group called Vite, and then we joined the Jira and Github teams.
Then we discussed everyone's division of labor, and I was in charge of front-end development.

Week2
We discussed the project direction and scheme, and then we needed to write a proposal.
I was responsible for writing the background of the proposal and explaining the background and positioning of the product.

Week3
We wrote the proposal and submitted it.
We started writing the content of Sprint1, putting together the framework of the front and back ends,
and implementing the basic routing, interface, and other functions.

Week4
I wrote a feature for users to upload and modify their avatars, but the effect was not very good.
We refactored this part later.

Week5
We completed the Demo A and Retrospective A. Our tutor gave us some suggestions for our work of Sprint 1 in the first demonstration.
We needed to check the email and the difficulty of password.
At the same time, we also needed to disable the user's permission to change their nicknames.

Week6
I built the framework of the DetailPage and Public/Search recipes part.
I started to develop the function of 'showing the public/my recipe lists' and 'showing the detail of the public/my recipes' on the front end.

Week7
In this week I developed a search recipe function.
We prepared for the Demo B.

Week8
We completed the Demo B and Retrospective B. We migrated the serve of back end to make the Apis acquisition faster.
And I fixed some bugs of search/detail.

Week9
I finished the development of 'showing recommended recipes' in the detail pages, and I fixed all bugs of my part.

Week10
We integrated our code and deployed our front end, back end and database systems on the AWS cloud.
We finished the final presentation, wrote the report and submitted the report and code.
Thank you to every one of my teammates! Happy Ending!
